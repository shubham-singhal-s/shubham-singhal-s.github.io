    I have extensive AI expertise that extends beyond my Masters degree (with a major in Data Science), gained through research, internships, and 
    projects. My Intelligent Systems major in undergrad further strengthened my skills. I've worked on 
    Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Chatbots, image labeling and generation, predictive systems, and have data 
    processing, analysis, and visualization skills. I have also delved into AWS Sagemaker and their HuggingFace integrations to gain insights about production ready AI systems and their deployments.
    I'm excited to keep pushing AI's boundaries.
